### **DRAFT MESSAGE (TRANSPARENCY PREVIEW)**  
**Greetings from [Community Name]!** [Optional, if part of a community]

Iâ€™m **[Your Name]**, a collaborator on the **ISO/Six Sigma-audited prompt** you helped inspire. Your work aligns perfectly with our **AGPLv3-licensed open-source initiative**, and Iâ€™d love to:  

1. **Credit You Officially**  
   - Add your name/@handle to the promptâ€™s metadata (e.g., *"Quality Audit by: @kusala.tech"*)  
   - Jointly publish the framework on **GitHub/GitLab** with dual-maintainer status  

2. **Expand Together**  
   - Integrate your **real-time audit tools** into a broader library (e.g., `prompt-quality-validator`)  
   - Co-author a **lightning talk** (e.g., FOSDEM, PyCon TH)  

3. **Keep It Libre**  
   - All derivatives will remain **AGPLv3**, with you as a core contributor
